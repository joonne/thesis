	abstract="Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.",

	title={Towards a Reference Framework for Open Source
	Software Adoption},
	abstract={Abstract. Nowadays, the use of Open Source Software (OSS) components has
	become a driver for the primary and secondary information technology (IT)
	sector, among other factors, by the openness and innovation benefits that can give
	to the organizations, regardless of its business model and activities’ nature.
	Nevertheless, IT companies and organizations still face numerous difficulties and
	challenges when making the strategic move to OSS. OSS is aligned with new
	challenges, which mainly derive from the way OSS is produced and the culture
	and values of OSS communities. In fact, OSS adoption impacts far beyond
	technology, because it requires a change in the organizational culture and
	reshaping IT decision-makers mindset. Therefore, this research work proposes a
	framework to support OSS adopters (i.e., software-related organizations that
	develop software and/or offer services relate to software) to analyze and evaluate
	the impact of adopting OSS as part of their software products and/or services
	offered to their customers/users, mainly in terms of their software related
	activities},

	title={Towards an OSS adoption business impact assessment},
	booktitle={PoEM 2015},
	language={finnish},
	abstract={Nowadays, the adoption of Open Source Software (OSS) by organizations is becoming a strategic need in a wide variety of application areas. Organizations adopt OSS in very diverse ways. The way in which they adopt OSS affects and shapes their businesses. Therefore, knowing the impact of different OSS adoption strategies in the context of an organization may help improving the processes undertaken inside this organization and ultimately pave the road to strategic moves. However, there is a lack of support for assessing the impact of the OSS adoption over the business of the adopter organizations. Based on the goal-oriented characterization of some OSS adoption strategies, in this paper, we propose a preliminary approach to assess the business impact of the OSS adoption strategies over the adopter organizations. The proposal is based on the Business Model Canvas and graph theory notions to support the elicitation and assessment of the impact of each goal over the adopter organization. We illustrate the application of the approach in the context of a telecommunications company.},
